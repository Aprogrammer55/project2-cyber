Level 0 → Level 1

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

---


Level 12 → Level 13

Level Goal



The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)













Commands you may need to solve this level



grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file






---


Level 13 → Level 14

Level Goal



The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Look at the commands that logged you into previous bandit levels, and find out how to use the key for this level.








Commands you may need to solve this level



ssh, scp, umask, chmod, cat, nc, install




---


Level 14 → Level 15

Level Goal


The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.








Commands you may need to solve this level



ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap





---

Level 15 → Level 16

Level Goal



The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.






Commands you may need to solve this level




ssh, telnet, nc, ncat, socat, openssl, s_client, nmap, netstat, ss






---

Level 16 → Level 17

Level Goal



The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.





Commands you may need to solve this level



ssh, telnet, nc, ncat, socat, openssl, s_client, nmap, netstat, ss





---

Level 17 → Level 18

Level Goal


There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19






Commands you may need to solve this level



cat, grep, ls, diff








---

Level 18 → Level 19


Level Goal


The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.






Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, ls, cat



---

Level 19 → Level 20

Level Goal


To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.





Commands you may need to solve this level




---

Level 20 → Level 21

Level Goal





There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think






Commands you may need to solve this level


ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)


---
Level 21 → Level 22


Level Goal



A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.



Commands you may need to solve this level




cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)





---
Level 22 → Level 23

Level Goal



A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.



Commands you may need to solve this level


cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)




---
Level 23 → Level 24


Level Goal




A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…








Commands you may need to solve this level




chmod, cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)





---
Level 24 → Level 25


Level Goal



A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time







Commands you may need to solve this level


---

Level 25 → Level 26


Level Goal





Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.





Commands you may need to solve this level


ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd







---
Level 26 → Level 27


Level Goal



Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!






Commands you may need to solve this level


ls


---
Level 27 → Level 28


Level Goal



There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit27-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

---
Level 28 → Level 29



Level Goal




There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.
